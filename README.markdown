The `'undofile'` is a great feature, and I use it a lot. However, one annoyance
is that it's very easy to accidentally undo changes that I did the last time I
opened the file; which may be 2 minutes ago, an hour ago, last week, or a
month ago.
So what would happen is that sometimes I would accidentally undo changes from
ages ago.

This plugin fixes that by showing a warning.

I originally posted this as an answer on vi StackExchange, which also has some
other solutions to the same problem:
