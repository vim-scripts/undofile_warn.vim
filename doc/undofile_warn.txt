*undofile_warn.txt* Warn when using the undofile.

INTRODUCTION                                                   *undofile-warn*

The 'undofile' is a great feature, and I use it a lot. However, one annoyance
is that it's very easy to accidentally undo changes that I did the last time I
opened the file; which may be 2 minutes ago, an hour ago, last week, or a
month ago.
So what would happen is that sometimes I would accidentally undo changes from
ages ago.

This plugin fixes that by showing a warning.

I originally posted this as an answer on vi StackExchange, which also has some
other solutions to the same problem:

MAPPINGS                                              *undofile-warn-mappings*

This plugin overwrites the |u| and |<C-r>| mappings:
>
	nmap u     <Plug>(undofile-warn-undo)
	nmap <C-r> <Plug>(undofile-warn-redo)
<
You can prevent this by setting *g:undofile_warn_no_map* to 1.
